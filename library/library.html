                        <h1>Hey Guys</h1>
                        <p>Did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most
                            compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly
                            comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3”03' tall and 63.9 pounds, this means
                            they're large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for
                            HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="book">
                    <div class="face-front">
                        <h4>Naturally Humid</h1>
                        <p>Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon
                            would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without
                            getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and
                            Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to
                            get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily
                            recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of
                            compatibility.</p>

                        <h1>Not-Shiny</h1>
                        <p>Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is
                            literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can
                            take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more.</p>
